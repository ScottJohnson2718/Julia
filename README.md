Julia work for practice:

BigTen.csv is the Big Ten football scores for weeks 7, 8, and 9 for 2019.
The other file is an IJulia file that implements the least squares algorithm from "Linear Algebra and It's Applications" by Gilbert Strang.
The math makes predictions of future game scores from past game scores.
